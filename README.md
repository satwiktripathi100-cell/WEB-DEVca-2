This project is a simple and beginner-friendly Student Portfolio Website created using only HTML and CSS. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the basic concepts of web development, including webpage structure, navigation, styling, layout, and form design. The website is designed as a single-page application with slider-based navigation, allowing users to switch between sections without reloading the page. This makes the website smooth, clean, and easy to use.

The website contains four main sections: Home, About, Skills, and Contact. The Home section welcomes visitors and introduces the purpose of the portfolio. The About section provides a short introduction about me, including my background and interests. The Skills section highlights the basic technical skills I have learned so far. The Contact section includes a simple form where users can enter their name, email, and message.

The navigation bar is common for all sections, making the website well-organized and user-friendly. CSS is used for page layout, font styling, background colors, and the sliding animation effect. This project helped me understand how HTML and CSS work together to build functional and visually appealing web pages. It reflects my progress as a first-year CSE(AI) student learning the fundamentals of web development.
